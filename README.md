Overview of the project
OBJECTIVE:
The objective of a simple calculator program in Python is to provide a basic tool for performing arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

KEYACTIVITIES:
User Interaction: Allow users to input numbers and select operations through a simple text-based interface.
Basic Arithmetic Operations: Implement core functions to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Error Handling: Handle potential errors, such as division by zero or invalid input, gracefully. 
Output Results: Display the result of the selected operation to the user. 
Flexibility: Provide a way to perform multiple calculations in a session, often through a loop or menu system.

 OUTPUT: 
 Welcome to the basic calculator! 
 Enter the first number: 10
 Enter the second number: 20 
 Select operation: 
 1.Addition
 2. Subtraction 
 3. Multiplication 
 4. Division 
 Enter the number of the operation you want to perform (1/2/3/4): 4 
 Result: 10+20 = 30.0
